All values shall be signed integers with a storage size of 32 bits (4 bytes)

Top level is always a program, we can add and subtract integers in this very basic program.
The syntax used in these documents are based on standard language description and some simple
regex statements, everything between ' is the used character in the language, for example '=' is
used as the assign statement. Note that we add a variable and a identifier so we cannot assign to
constant values with the assign statement.

Regex examples:
    ((X)* => Zero or more X)
    (X|Y => Either X or Y)


Constants:
    NUMBER  : 32 bit signed constant number
    ID      : Name of variable, by which it can be referenced
    ADD_OP  : Sub/Add
    END_OP  : Newline/SemiColon




program:
    statement (END_OP statement)*

statement:
    assign|expr

assign:
    identifier '=' expr

expr:
    variable (ADD_OP variable)*

variable:
    identifier|const

identifier:
    ID

const:
    NUMBER
