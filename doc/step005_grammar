All values shall be signed integers with a storage size of 32 bits (4 bytes)

Now we need to handle declaration, in other words, you have to declare a variable before you
can use it in other statements




Regex examples:
    ((X)* => Zero or more X)
    (X|Y  => Either X or Y)
    (X?   => X is optional)

Constants:
    NUMBER  : 32 bit signed constant number
    ID      : Name of variable, by which it can be referenced
    POST_OP : PostIncrement/PostDecrement
    PRE_OP  : PreIncrement/PreDecrement/Negate/Invert/Not
    MUL_OP  : Multiply/Divide/And/Shift
    ADD_OP  : Add/Sub/Or/Xor
    END_OP  : Newline/SemiColon

program:
    statement (END_OP statement)*

statement:
    assign|expr|declare

declare:
    identifier ':=' expr

assign:
    identifier '=' expr

expr:
    term (ADD_OP term)*

term:
    factor (MUL_OP factor)*

factor:
    (PRE_OP)* preinc

preinc:
    variable|('(' expr ')') (POST_OP)?

variable:
    identifier|const

identifier:
    ID

const:
    NUMBER
