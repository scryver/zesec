All values shall be signed integers with a storage size of 32 bits (4 bytes)

We extend our program with logical operators and a new level of operators
Notice that precedence is denotated by the operator level followed by the
argument list after the ':', for example Multiply before And, or Or before Xor.



Regex examples:
    ((X)* => Zero or more X)
    (X|Y => Either X or Y)


Constants:
    NUMBER  : 32 bit signed constant number
    ID      : Name of variable, by which it can be referenced
    MUL_OP  : Multiply/Divide/And/Shift
    ADD_OP  : Sub/Add/Or/Xor
    END_OP  : Newline/SemiColon



program:
    statement (END_OP statement)*

statement:
    assign|expr

assign:
    identifier '=' expr

expr:
    term (ADD_OP term)*

term:
    variable (MUL_OP variable)*

variable:
    identifier|const

identifier:
    ID

const:
    NUMBER
